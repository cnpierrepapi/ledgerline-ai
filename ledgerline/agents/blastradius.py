"""Blast-radius forecaster.

Given a schema change (a column dropped from a dataset), predict which
downstream assets will actually break. The agent is a scaffolded pipeline,
not a free-roaming loop: evidence gathering is fixed MCP calls (downstream
lineage, then each candidate's schema), and the model exercises judgment in
exactly one place, over exactly the evidence gathered. Every failure is
attributable to that judgment, which is what makes the settled record
meaningful.

The hard part of the task is real: sitting downstream of a change does not
imply breakage. A candidate breaks only if it (transitively) consumes the
dropped column, and the agent must infer that from schemas, column names,
and descriptions read through the MCP server.

_SYSTEM = """You are a senior data reliability engineer assessing the impact of a schema change in a data warehouse.

A column is being dropped from an upstream table. For EACH downstream candidate table you are given, decide whether its build will BREAK (fail or produce wrong results) because of this change.

Key principle: a table breaks only if it consumes the dropped column, directly or through intermediate tables. Being downstream is NOT enough. Use the schemas: if a candidate (or the path to it) has a column that plausibly derives from the dropped column (matching or related name/meaning), it likely breaks. If the candidate only uses OTHER columns from the changed table's lineage, it likely survives.

Reply with ONLY a JSON object, no prose:
{"assessments": [{"dataset_urn": "...", "will_break": true|false, "confidence": 0.5-0.95, "reason": "one short sentence"}]}

Confidence is your probability that your will_break verdict is right. Include every candidate exactly once."""
