"""Turn a reconstructed change stream into settled claims per writer.

P1 (`provenance.py`) reads a catalog's real change history. This layer decides,
for each metadata write in that history, whether it was an assertion that held
up or one that a steward undid, and records it as a claim in the same ledger the
simulated agents use, so the same skill-vs-luck test and trust score apply to
real writers pulled from a live catalog.

The settlement rule (agreed design):

  revert (heavy)   a LATER change by a DIFFERENT actor clears the value
                   (documentation blanked or removed) or overwrites it with
                   different text. This is a steward correcting the writer, so
                   the write settles wrong at the time of the correction.
  survived (light) the write is still the current value after a survival window
                   and nobody contradicted it. Weak positive: it settles right,
                   but see below for why survival is deliberately cheap.
  unsettled        the write is still current but younger than the window; its
                   outcome is not known yet, so it stays open.

Survival is a weak positive by construction, not by a hand-tuned weight:

  1. Reconstructed claims carry an implicit confidence below 1.0. Under the
     Brier score a wrong claim at confidence c costs c^2 while a right one gains
     only (1-c)^2, so at 0.75 a revert weighs about nine times a survival. That
     asymmetry is the "revert heavy, survival light" rule with no look-ahead.
  2. The skill verdict scores wins against the pooled acceptance rate across all
     reconstructed claims. When survival is the norm the pooled rate is high, so
     surviving does not look skilled; only being reverted less than the pool (or
     out-surviving a weak rival) earns a skilled verdict.
  3. Trust shrinks toward neutral by settled-claim count, so a handful of
     survivals cannot mint a high score.

A write superseded by the SAME actor (the writer revising its own text) is not a
steward signal; the earlier write is left unsettled rather than counted.
