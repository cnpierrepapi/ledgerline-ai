"""Live proof for the timeline provenance reader (P1).

Reconstructs the demo catalog's real change history straight from the DataHub
Timeline API and summarizes it: how many changes, by (actor, work kind), and how
many fields show the add-then-cleared shape the settlement layer reads as a
revert. Run on the box: DATAHUB_GMS_URL=http://localhost:8080 python scripts/prov_probe.py
