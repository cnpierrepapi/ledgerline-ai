"""Live end-to-end proof of the trust gateway against the real stack.

Every step here runs the production path: a real MCP client connects to the
real gateway process, which spawns the real mcp-server-datahub against the
live DataHub instance. Nothing is faked; the only scripted element is the
steward's judgment, which in production is a human action and is performed
here as a real catalog revert.

The scenario is the product pitch end to end:

  1. the gateway mirrors the downstream tool surface exactly
  2. reads through the gateway carry trust context from the structured
     properties the writeback layer planted
  3. an uninstrumented agent's write is recorded as an implicit claim AND
     forwarded to the catalog for real
  4. a steward reverts the write (real update_description restoring the
     accepted text) and the implicit claim settles as wrong
  5. with policy=enforce and a trust floor, the same agent's next write is
     rejected before touching the catalog, no claim is recorded for it, and
     reads still work

Exits non-zero if any check fails.
